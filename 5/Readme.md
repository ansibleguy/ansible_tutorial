# Programming basics

To use Ansible efficiently you will need to know some programming basics.

As Ansible is built on-top of Python3 - therefore I will use that programming language in my examples.

## Variables

* [Variables](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_variables.asp)
* [Scopes](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_scope.asp)

## Loops

* [For loops](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_for_loops.asp)
* [While loops](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_while_loops.asp)

## Data-Types

Only the most basic data-types will be discussed here.

* [Boolean](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_booleans.asp)
* [String](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_strings.asp)
* [List](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists.asp)
* [Tuple](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_tuples.asp)
* [Integer/Float](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_numbers.asp)
* [Dictionary](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_dictionaries.asp)

## Interaction with data
